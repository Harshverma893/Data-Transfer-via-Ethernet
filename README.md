## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Git  
- Two laptops connected via the same Ethernet network  
- Admin access to set IP addresses

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. üîå Configure Ethernet IP (Host System)

#### On **Windows**:
- Go to: Control Panel ‚Üí Network and Sharing Center ‚Üí Change Adapter Settings
- Right-click **Ethernet** ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Select **IPv4** ‚Üí Properties
- Set:
  - IP address: `192.168.1.100`
  - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
- Confirm using: `ipconfig`

#### On **Linux**:
```bash
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24 ipv4.method manual
```
> Use `ip addr` or `nmcli` to confirm your IP.

Make sure the second laptop is on the same subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.101`).

### 2. üì• Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshverma893/Data-Transfer-via-Ethernet.git
cd Data-Transfer-via-Ethernet
```

### 3. üß™ Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. üì¶ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 5. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

```bash
python app.py --host 192.168.1.100 --port 5002
```

> Replace the host IP with your actual IP. Make sure port `5002` is allowed through the firewall.
